## Introduction
Secrets Within the Compound is set in a world where a secret international organization, the Human Preservation Agency, has been set up to help preserve human life on Earth against a myriad of threats, such as ghosts, vampires, demons, and so on; at least, that’s what the Human Preservation Agency tells itself.
The Human Preservation Agency maintains bases of operations around the world, known as compounds, this game takes place in one such compound… but this compound has a few problems. An unknown Subversive force has gained entry to the compound and walks amongst you. It’s the job of those loyal to the Human Preservation Agency to deduce what’s going on and deal with this Subversive element, before this problem gets out of hand, otherwise, it’s only a matter of time until the Agency’s operations collapse! To make matters even worse for the Agency, a wave of psychic energy has rippled through the compound, and the usual Agency safeguards have malfunctioned and now the ghosts of the deceased walk the corridors once again.

## Goals
Secrets Within the Compound is a social deduction game for 6-16 players, and one Narrator. One person assumes the position of the Narrator, whilst the other players receive a secret role and a secret characteristic at the start of the game, this determines what team they’re on and grants them powerful game altering abilities. The players are divided into two teams, the Loyalist team, and the Subversive team.
The Loyalists must deduce, using a combination of logic and social skills, who the Subversives are and eliminate them. The Loyalist team wins if there are no Subversive players left alive.
The Subversives must deceive their fellow players and remain hidden whilst they eliminate the Loyalists. The Subversive team wins if there is only 1, or less, Loyalist players left alive.
If the game results in a draw or stalemate then the Loyalist team win.
