## Introduction
Secrets Within the Compound is set in a world where a secret international organization, the
Human PreservationAgency, has been set up to help preserve human life on Earth against a myriad
of threats, such as ghosts, vampires, demons, and so on; at least, that’s what the Human
PreservationAgency tells itself.

The Human PreservationAgency maintains bases of operations around the world, known as
compounds, this game takes place in one such compound... but this compound has a few problems.
An unknown subversive force has gained entry to the compound and walks amongst you. It’s the
job of those loyal to the Human PreservationAgency to deduce what’s going on and deal with this
subversive element, before this problem gets out of hand, otherwise, it’s only a matter of time until
the Agency’s operations collapse! To make matters even worse for the Agency, a wave of psychic
energy has rippled through the compound, and the usualAgency safeguards have malfunctioned and
now the ghosts of the fallen walk the corridors once again.

## Goals
Secrets Within the Compound is a social deduction game for 8-16 players, and one
narrator. One person assumes the role of the narrator, whilst the other players receive a secret role
and a secret characteristic at the start of the game, this determines what team they’re on and grants
them powerful game altering abilities. The players are divided into two teams, the Loyalist team, and
the Subversive team.

The Loyalists must deduce, using a combination of logic and socialskills, who the
Subversives are and eliminate them, whilst attempting to maintain the cohesion of the compound.
The Loyalist team wins if there are no Subversive players left alive.

The Subversives must deceive their fellow players and remain hidden whilst they eliminate
the Loyalists or achieve their secret goals. The Subversive team wins if there are no Loyalist players
left alive, or if the compound cohesion reaches 0.

If the game results in a draw or stalemate then the Loyalist team win.
