Modules are collections of [[roles]] and [[characteristics]] that are either thematically or mechanically similar, or just play well together. In Secrets Within the Compound [[roles]] and [[characteristics]] from any module can be mixed and matched, but if youâ€™re wanting a simpler game in scope, then try playing with just the basic module: [[Standard Procedure]].
