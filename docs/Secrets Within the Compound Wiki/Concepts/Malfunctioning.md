A malfunctioning player is deceived by the narrator, in accordance with game mechanics and rules, into believing their abilities are functioning as normal, when in reality as long as they’re malfunctioning any informational abilities they have will yield arbitrary information, and any non-informational abilities cannot effect the state of the game. The only exception to not effecting the state of the game is that if a malfunctioning player uses a ‘once per game’ ability then it is used up, and they will not be able to use it again, even if they are no longer malfunctioning.
While giving arbitrary information to malfunctioning players can be used in part to balance the game, it should in most cases always be used in a deleterious manner to the player that is malfunctioning and their team.
A malfunctioning player only corrupts the information received by their own abilities, not other players abilities that target them.
# Examples of Malfunctioning
- The [[Assistant]] learns that John is the [[Analyst]]. Later in the game, the [[Assistant]] dies, causing John to now be malfunctioning. John wakes in the night to receive information from his [[Analyst]] ability. The Narrator gives John arbitrary information because he is malfunctioning.
