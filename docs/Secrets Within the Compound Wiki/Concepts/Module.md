Modules are collections of [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] that are either thematically or mechanically similar, or just play well together. In Secrets Within the Compound [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] from any module can be mixed and matched, but if youâ€™re wanting a simpler game in scope, then try playing with just the basic module: [[Standard Procedure]].
