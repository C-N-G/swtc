# Ability
You start on the [[Subversive]] team. You do not know you are the Accomplice. You think you are a different [[Loyalist]] [[role]], but you are not. The [[Antagonist]] knows who you are.

# Starting Effects
You neighbour the [[Antagonist]].

# Examples
- On the first night that the Accomplice is in play they join the [[Subversive]] team. The Accomplice thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The Narrator wakes the Accomplice up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[malfunctioning]].
- The Accomplice is [[malfunctioning]] on the first night they are in play. The Accomplice does not change team. The Accomplice thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The Narrator wakes the Accomplice up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]].

# How to Play
- Just because someone claims to be the [[Antagonist]] and tells you that you're the Accomplice doesn't mean they're telling the truth!
- There are ways in which you might not have started neighbouring the [[Antagonist]], such as is if one of your neighbours is a Prisoner.
- If you suspect that you're the Accomplice, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [[role]]. If the [[role]] you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the Accomplice.
- If you know you're the Accomplice, then you're probably on the [[Subversive]] team, but if you happened to be [[malfunctioning]] on the first night that you were in play, then you won't have changed team. Be careful!
- If you are certain that you're on the [[Subversive]] team and that you're the Accomplice, then you should do everything possible to keep the [[Antagonist]] safe. Try to divert attention onto yourself and away from them.


# How to Narrate
- Ensure that the Accomplice starts neighbouring an [[Antagonist]].
- On the first night that the Accomplice is in play, if they're not [[malfunctioning]], immediately change their team to [[Subversive]]. Treat the Accomplice as if they were the [[role]] that they believe themselves to be and as if that [[role]] was [[malfunctioning]].
- You can provide the Accomplice with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [[role]] they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [[detrimental]] to the [[Loyalist]] team.
