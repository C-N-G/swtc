# Ability
When you die, 2 players on your team (not yourself) become [[malfunctioning]].

# Examples
- The Technician is dismissed and dies. 2 players on their team (not them) immediately become [[malfunctioning]].
- The Technician is [[malfunctioning]]. The Technician dies during the night. Nobody becomes [[malfunctioning]].

# How to Play
- Do not die! Don't let the [[Subversive]] team find out that you're the Technician, otherwise they might target you.
- If you're about to be dismissed and have no other defence, you might as well come out and tell everyone you're the Technician. It's better that the [[Antagonist]] has to spend a night killing you instead of your team doing it for them through a dismissal.

# How to Narrate
- If the Technician dies, immediately mark 2 players on their team (not them) as [[malfunctioning]].
