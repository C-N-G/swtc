# Ability
You appear as a [[Subversive]] [[Antagonist]] to [[Loyalist]] players.

# Examples
- The [[Clairvoyant]] chooses the Prisoner. The Prisoner appears as [[Subversive]] to the [[Clairvoyant]]. The [[Clairvoyant]] incorrectly learns that their target is on the [[Subversive]] team.
- The Prisoner is [[malfunctioning]]. The [[Clairvoyant]] chooses the Prisoner. The [[Clairvoyant]] correctly learns that their target is on the [[Loyalist]] team.

# How to Play
- You need to convince your team that you are the Prisoner, but be careful because the Prisoner is also a great bluff for [[Subversive]] players!
- Try to become [[malfunctioning]], this will allow [[Loyalist]] players to learn your real team and [[role]].

# How to Narrate
- The Prisoner counts as a [[Subversive]] [[Antagonist]] for all starting effects and abilities. If someone chooses the Prisoner with an ability, then treat the Prisoner as if they were actually a [[Subversive]] [[Antagonist]].
