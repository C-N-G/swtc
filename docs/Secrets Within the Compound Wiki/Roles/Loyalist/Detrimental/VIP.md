# Ability
When you die, the Cohesion decreases by 3.

# Examples
- There is 3 Cohesion left. The VIP is dismissed, and dies. The Cohesion is immediately decreased by 3. The [[Subversive]] team win the game.
- The VIP is [[malfunctioning]]. The VIP is dismissed, and dies. The Cohesion is unchanged.

# How to Play
- Do not die! Don't let the [[Subversive]] team find out that you're the VIP, otherwise they might target you.
- If you're about to be dismissed and have no other defence, you might as well come out and tell everyone you're the VIP. It's better that the [[Antagonist]] has to spend a night killing you instead of your team doing it for them through a dismissal.
- Try to become [[malfunctioning]], this will allow you to die without decreasing the Cohesion.

# How to Narrate
- If the VIP dies, immediately decrease the Cohesion by 3.
