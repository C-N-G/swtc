# Ability
You do not know you are the Underachiever. You think you are an [[Agent]] [[role]], but you are not.

# Examples
- The Underachiever thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The Narrator wakes the Underachiever up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[malfunctioning]].
- The Underachiever is [[malfunctioning]]. There is no difference to their ability. The Underachiever thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The Narrator wakes the Underachiever up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[malfunctioning]].

# How to Play
- If you suspect that you're the Underachiever, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [[role]]. If the [[role]] you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the [[Accomplice]].

# How to Narrate
- Treat the Underachiever as if they were the [[role]] that they believe themselves to be and as if that [[role]] was [[malfunctioning]].
- You can provide the Underachiever with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [[role]] they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [[detrimental]] to the [[Loyalist]] team.
