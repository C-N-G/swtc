# Ability
Your neighbours cannot malfunction.

# Examples
- One of the Cook's neighbours chooses a player with the Obnoxious [[characteristic]], they do not become [[malfunctioning]] because they neighbour the Cook.
- The Cook is [[malfunctioning]]. One of the Cook's neighbours chooses a player with the Obnoxious [[characteristic]], they become [[malfunctioning]].

# How to Play
- Your ability is simple, but can be very useful for validating the information gained by your neighbours. Try to avoid ways in which you could become [[malfunctioning]], so as to always be of benefit to your neighbours.
- If you believe your neighbours aren't on your team, then it might be a good idea to get yourself dismissed so that you're no longer protecting your opponents.

# How to Narrate
- The first night that the Cook is in play, mark their neighbours as immune to [[malfunctioning]].
- If the Cook becomes [[malfunctioning]] remove the immunity from their neighbours.
