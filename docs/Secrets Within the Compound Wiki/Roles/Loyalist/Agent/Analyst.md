# Ability
Each night, you learn which team the Narrator thinks is winning.

# Examples
- The Subversive team are winning the game. Only one more night and they will almost certainly win the game. The Narrator wakes the Analyst and tells them that the Subversive team are winning.
- It is night 1. The Subversive team have not had any significant impact on the game. The Narrator wakes the Analyst and tells them that the Loyalist team are winning.
- It is the final night of the game. The Subversive team are winning and most players alive are clueless as to who the Antagonist is. The Analyst is malfunctioning. The Narrator wakes the Analyst and tells them that the Loyalist team are winning.

# How to Play
- Your role is fundamentally tied to the Narrator's opinion of the state of the game. The more you know about the Narrator and what they might think in certain situations, the more likely you are to be able to effectively use your ability.
- You should try to take note of anything that can change in the game, you might be able to link these changes to what the Narrator tells you. Try to think about how certain players dying might impact the balance of the game, and why that might cause the Narrator to give you a different team. This information could be vital in corroborating other players.
