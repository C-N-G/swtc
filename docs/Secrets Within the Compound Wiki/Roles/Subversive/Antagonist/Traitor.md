# Ability
You start knowing 3 not in-play [[Role|roles]]. Each night, after the first, you must choose a player: that player dies.

# Examples
- The Narrator wakes the Traitor up on the first night, and tells them 3 not in-play [[Role|roles]]. Each night, after the first night, the Narrator wakes the Traitor up to choose a player to kill.
- The Narrator wakes the Traitor up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. That player dies. At the start of the following day, the Narrator announces who has died.
- The Narrator wakes the Traitor up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. The Traitor chooses an already dead player, so their target does not die.
- It is the final day of the game. The Traitor is the last [[Subversive|Subversive]] player alive. The remaining [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] dismiss the Traitor, and the [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] win the game.
- The Narrator wakes the Traitor up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. The Traitor is [[malfunctioning]], so their target does not die.

# How to Play
- You should attempt to bluff as 1 of the 3 not in-play [[Role|roles]] you learnt at the start of the game, this means you won't accidentally claim someone else's [[role]].
- Like all [[Subversive]] players being able to bluff and fit in with the group is key to winning the game. Try everything and anything to fit in, be careful though, if you're too active players might begin to suspect you. Sometimes being silent can work just as well.
- You can only kill one player at night, so make it count! Try to work out the [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] of other players so you can target the players who are most valuable to their team.
- If you want to frame someone who has just died as an [[Antagonist]] you could choose already dead players with your ability so that nobody new dies.

# How to Narrate
- The first night that the Traitor is in play wake up the Traitor. Tell them 3 [[Role|roles]] that are not in-play. Send them back to sleep.
- Each night, after the first, wake up the Traitor. Ask them to choose a player. Send them back to sleep. Mark their choice as dead. At the start of the following day, announce which player died at night.
