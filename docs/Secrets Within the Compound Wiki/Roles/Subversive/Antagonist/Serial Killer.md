# Ability
Each night, after the first, you must choose a player: that player dies.

# Examples
- The Narrator wakes the Serial Killer up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. That player dies. At the start of the following day, the Narrator announces who has died.
- The Narrator wakes the Serial Killer up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. The Serial Killer chooses an already dead player, so their target does not die.
- The Narrator wakes the Serial Killer up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. The Serial Killer is malfunctioning, so their target does not die.
- It is the final day of the game. The Serial Killer is the last [[Subversive]] player alive. The remaining [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] dismiss the Serial Killer, and the [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] win the game.

# How to Play
- Like all [[Subversive]] players being able to bluff and fit in with the group is key to winning the game. Try everything and anything to fit in, be careful though, if you're too active players might begin to suspect you. Sometimes being silent can work just as well.
- You can only kill one player at night, so make it count! Try to work out the [[roles]] and [[characteristics]] of other players so you can target the players who are most valuable to their team.
- If you want to frame someone who has just died as the Serial Killer, you could choose already dead players with your ability so that nobody new dies.

# How to Narrate
- Each night, after the first, wake up the Serial Killer. Ask them to choose a player. Send them back to sleep. Mark their choice as dead. At the start of the following day announce which player died at night.
