# Ability
Each night, after the first, you must choose a player: that player dies. The first time this game that a Vessel is killed by their own ability, a player of their choice becomes a Vessel on their team.

# Examples
- The Narrator wakes the Vessel up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. That player dies. At the start of the following day, the Narrator announces who has died.
- The Narrator wakes the Vessel up during the night and asks them to choose a player, and they choose themselves.  The Narrator asks them to choose a player to become a Vessel on their team. At the start of the following day, the Narrator announces who has died like normal.
- The Narrator wakes the Vessel up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. The Vessel chooses an already dead player, so their target does not die.
- The Narrator wakes the Vessel up during the night, and asks them to choose a player. The Vessel is [[malfunctioning]], so their target does not die.
- It is the final day of the game. The Vessel is the last [[Subversive|Subversive]] player alive. The remaining [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] dismiss the Vessel, and the [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] win the game.

# How to Play
- As the Vessel, you can choose to kill yourself, and if it's the first time that a Vessel has chosen themselves this game, then you will get to choose a new player who will become a Vessel and join your team. You should try to time killing yourself so as to remove suspicion from yourself, and you should also try to pick the most trusted player to become a Vessel.
- You can try to frame players who have died in the night as the Vessel who has killed themselves. However, be careful. Planting the idea that a Vessel is in the game could backfire on you.
- Like all [[Subversive]] players being able to bluff and fit in with the group is key to winning the game. Try everything and anything to fit in, be careful though, if you're too active players might begin to suspect you. Sometimes being silent can work just as well.
- You can only kill one player at night, so make it count! Try to work out the [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] of other players so you can target the players who are most valuable to their team.
- If you want to frame someone who has just died as an [[Antagonist]] you could choose already dead players with your ability so that nobody new dies.

# How to Narrate
- Each night, after the first, wake up the Vessel. Ask them to choose a player. If they didn't choose themselves, send them back to sleep. Mark their choice as dead. If they chose themselves, ask them to choose a player to become a Vessel on their team send them back to sleep. At the start of the following day, announce which player died at night.
